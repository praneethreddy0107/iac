```Purposes of subnets
 Subnets can be used for different purposes:

PRIVATE: A subnet to use for VM instances. This is the default subnet type.
PRIVATE_SERVICE_CONNECT: A subnet to use to publish a managed service by using Private Service Connect.
REGIONAL_MANAGED_PROXY: A proxy-only subnet to use with regional Envoy-based load balancers. 
```
